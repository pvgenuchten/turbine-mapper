# Turbine mapper

The tool visualises turbines in their natural surrounding - a threejs+maplibre implementation.

We strongly encourage the use of reproducable energy sources, such as wind and solar. But we acknowledge
that decissions on landschape design should be carefully made. We hope this tool can facilitate good discussion upfront.
To prevent disappointments.

Tool uses maplibre and three js to display 3d models on a map background (on the shoulders of giants). You can deploy the tool on your github.io by cloning this repo.
